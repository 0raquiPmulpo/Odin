The Great Escape was a challenging film to make, as it involved many technical difficulties and logistical problems. The film was shot mostly on location in Germany, where the filmmakers had to recreate the camp and the surrounding landscape. The film also required a large number of extras, vehicles, and props, which had to be transported and coordinated. The film also faced some weather issues, such as rain and snow, which delayed the shooting schedule.
 
The film also had some creative conflicts between the director and some of the actors. McQueen, who was already a rising star at the time, demanded more screen time and more action scenes for his character. He also clashed with Sturges over some of his stunts, which he insisted on doing himself. McQueen also had some disagreements with his co-stars, especially Attenborough, who played the leader of the escape. McQueen felt that Attenborough was too serious and uptight, while Attenborough felt that McQueen was too reckless and selfish.
 
Despite these difficulties, the film was completed on time and on budget. The film was well received by both critics and audiences, who praised its realism, suspense, humor, and emotion. The film also became a cultural phenomenon, inspiring many parodies, homages, and references in popular culture. The film also had a lasting impact on the lives of some of the actors, who became lifelong friends after working together on the film.
